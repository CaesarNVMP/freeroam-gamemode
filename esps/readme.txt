ESPs for freeroam will be added here. The NV:MP launcher will do a pre-connection download to these resources.
It's important to document the current SHA1 of the file, as this will be used to validate file integrity before attempting
to download.

Format:
- Example.esp
  The mod file to download.

- Example.esp.sha1
  A text file with the SHA1 hash of the file.
